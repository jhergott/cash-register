#  HELLO CHANGE
 
 At Rocketmiles, our team loves travelling. However, many places we travel don’t accept our credit cards, and we have to remember to 
 bring dollar bills with us. We’ve had to correct a few vendors about giving us the correct change from their cash registers, sometimes 
 we get too much and sometimes we get too little. Create a cash register that should be able to accept only $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1
 bills. Given the charge and amount of money received return the change in each denomination that should be given from the cash register. 
 Sometimes when the vendors couldn’t make exact change they would tell us they couldn’t make exact change.
 
Note: This solution is scoped to the crux of this problem which is the algorithm for making change.
